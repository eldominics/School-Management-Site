                    picked up my sleeves and shorts and headed for the streets. 
                    I did some warm up moves like pushups, pressups and squats.
                    I felt the rush of adrenaline in my blood and knew it was time to do the main thing. 
                    I tied my shoe laces firmly and set off at a speed that could take off a plane. I ran for about half an hour
                    and decided it was time to stop.
